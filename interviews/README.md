These are the problems that I've gotten on technical interviews.

I most probably botched these problems while I was in the interview.
And yet.

I like learning. Every failure is a lesson. Please let it be a lesson. 

So instead of whining about it, I've tried to solve the problems after.

Note: Some problems are cool and got their own repos. I will try to list those here as well with links
